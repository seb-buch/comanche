File manifest
=============
Downloaded files are listed with SHA1 checksums. You can compute the
checksums of the downloaded files (e.g. with the 'openssl sha1' or
the 'sha1sum' commands) and compare them to the listed ones. If they
agree you have verified the files; it also allows a simple check of
which files changed between versions.
